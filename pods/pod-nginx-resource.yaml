      resources:   # You can specify how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs
        requests:  # Requests specify the *minimum* amount of CPU and RAM and k8s will *guarantee* this to the container
          cpu: "500m"  # CPU resources are measured in cpu units. One cpu, in k8s, equals 1 vCPU in AWS (0.5 vCPU == 500m)
          memory: "64Mi"  # Memory resources are measured in Bytes. 64Mi == 64 MB == 2 ** 26 Bytes
        limits:      # Set a Max limit on CPU and Memory that the container cannot exceed
          cpu: "1"   # k8s will configure the Linux kernel to ensure that this limit cannot be exceeded by the container
          memory: "512Mi"  # Pod's Quality of Service Class is Burstable
